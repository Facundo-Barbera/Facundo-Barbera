## Revisit

I want to revist these projects. I have added a couple of things that need to be done so that I feel that they are completed.
The reason I also marked them as completed is because they have working releases, but I feel like they need a bit more.

### [Scraping Library](https://github.com/Facundo-Barbera/Scraping-Library)

Here is what's pending in this project:
- [ ] Adding books to scrape to the project.
- [ ] Adding a scrapper for WHO.
     

### [U.S. Medical Insurance Costs](https://github.com/Facundo-Barbera/us-medical-insurance-costs)

This project is one that I took a long time to make and didn't quite finish how I wanted to.
I want to re-visit this project with a different focus.
Originally the ideas was to create a simple EDA, but I kept adding stuff to it.
Next time, I want to create an EDA, and modeling part of the project to create prediction models using the dataset.
Also, although the dataset was obtained from Codecademy, I now know the origin of the dataset, and I would like
to find similar datasets and explore further information.
